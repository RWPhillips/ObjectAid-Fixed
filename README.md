# ObjectAid-Fixed

This is the ObjectAid plugin for Eclipse, updated to work with Eclipse in 2023.
ObjectAid's developer was in a tragic accident, therefore ObjectAid has not been updated since. As Eclipse has been updated in recent years, ObjectAid had stopped working.

I was able to find out what was wrong with ObjectAid and get it working with the latest version of Eclipse. Therefore, I'm sharing this file in hopes this can help others who are also looking for a UML solution.
